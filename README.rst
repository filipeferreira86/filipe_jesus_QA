My aproch for this test was to do it as simple and reusable as possible, so the idea is that usinig this script you should be able to test any error messagem for login page just by changing the parameters in the feature file.

For execute this test suit is necessary to install behave for this just go to your console (command line) and use:
    pip install behave

For execute this, in the console inside the features package just run the command:
  behave login.feature
  
For change the parameters of execution in the login.feature (inside the "")
